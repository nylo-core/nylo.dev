## Introduction

Nylo is a micro-framework for Flutter which is designed to help simplify app development. Every project provides a simple boilerplate to help you build apps easier.
This project is open source and MIT-licenced too so you can freely build your projects.

New installs of Nylo contain standardized file structure and config so you can jump straight into developing your project.

## New to Flutter?

A great place to start is the official [Flutter website](https://flutter.dev). 
They have tons of docs to help you understand how things work from the core. 

You can also subscribe to their YouTube channel for updates and what's happening in the community.

The Nylo framework follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org).
