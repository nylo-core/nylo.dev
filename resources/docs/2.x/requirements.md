## Installing Flutter

To use Nylo you'll need to already have Flutter installed. You can check out the [Flutter docs](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) for how to get set up.

**Minimum Flutter version: v2.8.0**

**Minimum Dart version: v2.15.0**

---

You can check your Flutter version by running the below command.

``` bash
flutter --version
```

If your version is not higher than v2.8.0 then you can run the below to get on a stable release.

``` bash
flutter channel stable
flutter upgrade
flutter doctor -v
```

## Set up an editor

You can use most IDE's to build your Flutter projects. Two known favourites are [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) and [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
Once you have your editor, you can use the simulator or your device to test your projects.
