## Introduction

{{ config('app.name') }} is a micro-framework for Flutter which is designed to help simplify app development. Every project provides a simple boilerplate to help you build apps easier. 

It also comes with a ready-made file structure and setup, letting you start developing right away. Out the box, you'll have access to routing, localization, themes, local storage, push notifications, and more.
