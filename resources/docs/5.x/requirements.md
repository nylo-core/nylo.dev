## Installing Flutter

To use {{ config('app.name') }}, you'll need to have Flutter installed. Check out the <a href="https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install" target="_blank">Flutter docs</a> for how to get set up.

**Minimum Flutter version: v3.7.0**

**Minimum Dart version: v2.19.0**

---

You can check your Flutter version by running the below command.

``` bash
flutter --version
```

If your version is not higher than v3.7.0 then you can run the below to get a stable release.

``` bash
flutter channel stable
flutter upgrade
flutter doctor -v
```

## Set up an editor

<a href="https://developer.android.com/studio">Android Studio</a> or <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com">VSCode</a> are great options for a Flutter environment.
- Set up <a href="https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/editor?tab=androidstudio" target="_BLANK">Android Studio</a>
- Set up <a href="https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/editor?tab=vscode" target="_BLANK">VS Code</a>

When your editor is ready, you can start building Flutter applications.
