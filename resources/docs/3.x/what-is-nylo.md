## Introduction

Nylo is a micro-framework for Flutter which is designed to help simplify app development. Every project provides a simple boilerplate to help you build apps easier.
This project is open source and MIT-licenced too so you can freely build your projects.

New installs of Nylo contain standardized file structure and config so you can jump straight into developing your project.
