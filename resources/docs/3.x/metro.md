It provides a lot of helpful tools to speed up development.

## Install

Mac guide

1. **Open your bash\_profile**

``` bash
sudo open ~/.bash_profile
```

2. **Add this alias to your bash\_profile**
``` bash
...
alias metro='flutter pub run nylo_framework:main'
```

3. **Then run the following**
``` bash
source ~/.bash_profile
```

If you open a project that uses Nylo, try to run the following in the terminal.

``` bash
metro
```

You should see an output similar to the below.

``` bash

## Make controller

You can make a new controller by running the below in the terminal.

``` bash
flutter pub run nylo_framework:main make:controller profile_controller
```

Or with the alias metro

``` bash
flutter pub run nylo_framework:main make:model product
```

Or with the alias metro

``` bash
metro make:model product
```

It will place the newly created model in `lib/app/models/`.

If you plan to use the same model to represent objects from your API's, add it to your `lib/config/decoders.dart` modelDecoders map.

#### Arguments:

Using the `--force` flag will overwrite an exiting class if it already exists.

``` bash
metro make:model product --force
```

Using the `--storage` flag will create a new model that is storable to the users local storage.

``` bash
metro make:model product --storable
```
